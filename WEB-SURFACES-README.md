# 🌞 1. Surface Web — The Visible Part of the Internet
This is the part of the internet that search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo can access and index. Everything you can find with a simple Google search lives here.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>News Website</li>
  <li>YouTube</li>
  <li>Wikepedia</li>
  <li>Online shopping sites</li>
  <li>Social media platforms</li>
</ul>

# 🌊 2. Deep Web — The Hidden But Legal Section\
This includes all web pages and databases not indexed by search engines. You need special access — like a password or login — to reach them. But don’t get it twisted — the Deep Web isn’t “illegal”; it’s just private.
<strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Yoyr email inbox</li>
  <li>Your online banking dashboard</li>
  <li>Corporate intranets</li>
  <li>Medical records, academic databases, private cloud drives</li>
</ul>

# 🌑 3. Dark Web — The Encrypted Underground
This is a small part of the Deep Web, intentionally hidden and only accessible via special software like Tor (The Onion Router). Here, users and website owners are anonymous — their IP addresses are masked.
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Anonymous forums and whistleblower sites (like SecureDrop)</li>
  <li>Black markets selling drugs, weapons, or stolen data</li>
  <li>Hacking communities, privacy-focused chat rooms</li>
</ul>
