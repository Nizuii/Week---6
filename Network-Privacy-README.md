VPNs, proxies, and Tor are all tools used to increase privacy and security online, but they work differently, have distinct purposes, and suit different scenarios.

# 🌐 VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A VPN establishes a private network connection over the internet, encrypting your internet traffic and routing it through a secure server operated by the VPN provider. This hides your IP address and online activity from your ISP and third parties, making it harder to track or intercept your data. VPNs can be used to access restricted content, bypass censorship, and maintain privacy for both individuals and organizations.​

# ⛓️‍💥 Proxy Server
A proxy acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your requests go through the proxy server, which retrieves data on your behalf and sends it to you. Proxies can hide your real IP address and allow access to geo-blocked sites, but most proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving your data vulnerable to interception by third parties and making them less secure than VPNs.​

# 🧅 Tor (The onion router)
Tor is designed for strong anonymity by routing your internet traffic through multiple volunteer-operated servers, called nodes or relays. With at least three hops—entry, middle relay, and exit—Tor obscures your data's origin, making it extremely difficult to trace your identity. Tor is free, decentralized, and commonly used for accessing the dark web, whistleblowing, and bypassing censorship, but it is often slower and restricted to traffic that goes through the Tor browser.​

<h2>When to Use Each</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use VPNs for secure, encrypted browsing, streaming, and bypassing censorship across your whole device.</li>
  <li>Use proxies for simple tasks needing IP masking, like bypassing basic website restrictions, but not for sensitive tasks.</li>
  <li>Use Tor when maximum anonymity is essential, especially for whistleblowing, research, or getting around strict censorship, knowing it is slower and only covers browser traffic.​</li>
</ul>
> Each method has its own strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases, giving you options based on your privacy needs.
