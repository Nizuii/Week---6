# üîê Information Security.
Information security is the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, use, modification and destruction. In simple terms its about keeping information safe from Hackers. mistakes or threats.

# üîë Understanding the core idea.
The protection of infosec relies on 3 key principle concepts known as CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availaility)
<ul>
  <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensures only authorised people can access the data. (Like using passwords or encryption)</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Keeps data accurate and prevents unauthorised changes. (Example: Protecting a file from beign altered by a malware.)</li>
  <li><strong>Availablity:</strong> Make sure information and systems are accessable when needed. (Such as ensuring websites remains online during attacks.)</li>
</ul>

# ‚ùî Why information security matters.
Protecting infosec matters because:
<ul>
  <li>It <strong>prevents cyber attacks</strong> like hacking, phishing and data breaches.</li>
  <li>It <strong>avoids financial losses</strong> caused by stolen or deleted data/</li>
  <li>It helps <strong>organisations follow regulation</strong> and gain customer trust.</li>
</ul>
For example, losing customer data in a breach can harm company's reputation and result in fines.

# üõ°Ô∏è Core areas of infosec.
Information security is divided into several core areas that work together to protect data across systems, networks and application.
<ol>
  <li><h3>Network Security.</h3></li>
  Network security protects the flow of data across network by preventing unauthorized access, misuse or attacks. It uses firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and virtual private networks (VPNs) to blocks threats and monitor traffic.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Maintain integrity and secure communication paths between systems.
  
  <li><h3>Application Security.</h3></li>
  Application security focuses on protecting software and applications from vulnerabilities and exploits. It involves secure coding practices, regular testing and patch managemen to reduce risks like injection attacks or data leaks.
  <strong>Goals:</strong> Keeps apps and API's secure thriugh their life cycle.
  
  <li><h3>Data Security.</h3></li>
  Data security ensures confidentiality, integrity and availability of both digital and physical data. It relies on encryption, access controls and backup systems to protect information against unauthorized data or loss.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Ensures that sensitive data is only seen or modified by authorized users.

  <li><h3>Cloud security.</h3></li>
  Cloud security safeguards data, applications, and services hosted in cloud environments. It combines identity and access management, encryption, and compliance monitoring to prevent cloud-specific risks like unauthorized access or misconfigurations.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Protect cloud-based infrastructure and data integrity.

  <li><h3>Infrastructure security.</h3></li>
  Infrastructure security defends the physical and virtual components of IT infrastructure‚Äîsuch as servers, data centers, and mobile devices‚Äîfrom attacks and disruptions.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Keep organizational systems and underlying hardware resilient against compromise.‚Äã

  <li><h3>Cryptography.</h3></li>
  Cryptography uses encryption algorithms to transform readable information into an unreadable form. Only authorized users with proper keys can decrypt it. Techniques like digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI) ensure privacy and authenticity.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Protect data confidentiality and prove authenticity of communications.

  <li><h3>Incident response.</h3></li>
  Incident response prepares for, detects, and reacts to security incidents such as data breaches or malware outbreaks. Organizations use incident response plans (IRPs) to reduce damage and restore operations quickly.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Minimize impact and prevent recurrence of breaches.

  <li><h3>Vulnerability and risk management</h3></li>
  This area focuses on identifying, assessing, and resolving security weaknesses in systems before attackers exploit them. Tools like vulnerability scanners and patch management software are commonly used.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Maintain security by addressing known risks proactively.

  <li><h3>Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)</h3></li>
  GRC connects InfoSec activities with business goals and legal requirements. It ensures organizations follow security standards and government regulations such as GDPR or ISO 27001.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Align security programs with laws, business strategies, and ethical standards.

  <li><h3>Physical security.</h3></li>
  While most InfoSec areas focus on digital defense, physical security controls (CCTV, access cards, and locks) prevent unauthorized individuals from physically accessing data storage or computing systems.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Protect hardware and facilities housing critical data.
</ol>
