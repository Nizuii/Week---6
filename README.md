# üîê Information Security.
Information security is the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, use, modification and destruction. In simple terms its about keeping information safe from Hackers. mistakes or threats.

# üîë Understanding the core idea.
The protection of infosec relies on 3 key principle concepts known as CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availaility)
<ul>
  <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensures only authorised people can access the data. (Like using passwords or encryption)</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Keeps data accurate and prevents unauthorised changes. (Example: Protecting a file from beign altered by a malware.)</li>
  <li><strong>Availablity:</strong> Make sure information and systems are accessable when needed. (Such as ensuring websites remains online during attacks.)</li>
</ul>

# ‚ùî Why information security matters.
Protecting infosec matters because:
<ul>
  <li>It <strong>prevents cyber attacks</strong> like hacking, phishing and data breaches.</li>
  <li>It <strong>avoids financial losses</strong> caused by stolen or deleted data/</li>
  <li>It helps <strong>organisations follow regulation</strong> and gain customer trust.</li>
</ul>
For example, losing customer data in a breach can harm company's reputation and result in fines.

# üõ°Ô∏è Core areas of infosec.
Information security is divided into several core areas that work together to protect data across systems, networks and application.
<ol>
  <li><h3>1. Network Security.</h3></li>
  Network security protects the flow of data across network by preventing unauthorized access, misuse or attacks. It uses firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and virtual private networks (VPNs) to blocks threats and monitor traffic.
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Maintain integrity and secure communication paths between systems.
  
  <li><h3>2. Application Security.</h3></li>
  Application security focuses on protecting software and applications from vulnerabilities and exploits. It involves secure coding practices, regular testing and patch managemen to reduce risks like injection attacks or data leaks.
  <strong>Goals:</strong> Keeps apps and API's secure thriugh their life cycle.
  
  <li><h3>3. Data Security.</h3></li>
  
</ol>
