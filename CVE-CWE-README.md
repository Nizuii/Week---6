# ‚ùî What is CVE
<ul>
  <li>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.</li>
  <li>It is a public catalog of specific, real-world security flaws found in software, hardware, or firmware.</li>
  <li>Each flaw gets a unique ID (like CVE-2021-44228), making it easy for security teams, vendors, and researchers to talk about the same issue using the same label. Think of it as a "serial number" for each discovered bug.</li>
  <li>CVE entries include a brief description (but not all technical details) and are managed by the MITRE Corporation. More details (such as risk or how to fix it) are added by other databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</li>
  <li>Examples:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>CVE-2021-44228: Log4Shell, a software bug in Apache Log4j.</li>
    <li>CVE-2023-23397: Microsoft Outlook privilege escalation.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Why is CVE important</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It helps everyone use the same language to report, discuss, and fix vulnerable systems.</li>
  <li>Security tools use CVE IDs to track, monitor, and patch vulnerabilities across systems and devices.</li>
</ul>

# ‚ùî What is CWE
CWE stands for Common Weakness Enumeration.
It‚Äôs not about specific bugs like CVE ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs about the types of mistakes that cause those bugs.
Think of it like this:
> üß© ‚ÄúCWE is the category ‚Äî CVE is the example.‚Äù
<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs a catalog‚Äîa big list‚Äîof common types of weaknesses in software and hardware that can lead to vulnerabilities.</li>
  <l>Every CWE describes a class of mistake in code, architecture, or configuration, like "improper input validation" or "buffer overflow."</l>
  <li>Each type gets a CWE ID (like CWE-89 for SQL Injection).</li>
  <li>CWE focuses on root causes instead of individual flaws.</li>
  <li>Maintained by MITRE and community partners.</li>
</ul>

Examples:
<ul>
  <li>CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (‚ÄúCross-site Scripting‚Äù)</li>
  <li>CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in an SQL Command (‚ÄúSQL Injection‚Äù)</li>
</ul>
 <h2>Why is CWE Important</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>It helps developers learn about common coding mistakes to prevent vulnerabilities before they happen.</li>
   <li>Security tools map detected issues to CWE IDs, making it easier to identify recurring software mistakes and improve secure coding.</li>
