#‚ùî What is CVE
<ul>
  <li>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.</li>
  <li>It is a public catalog of specific, real-world security flaws found in software, hardware, or firmware.</li>
  <li>Each flaw gets a unique ID (like CVE-2021-44228), making it easy for security teams, vendors, and researchers to talk about the same issue using the same label. Think of it as a "serial number" for each discovered bug.</li>
  <li>CVE entries include a brief description (but not all technical details) and are managed by the MITRE Corporation. More details (such as risk or how to fix it) are added by other databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</li>
  <li>Examples:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>CVE-2021-44228: Log4Shell, a software bug in Apache Log4j.</li>
    <li>CVE-2023-23397: Microsoft Outlook privilege escalation.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Why is CVE important</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It helps everyone use the same language to report, discuss, and fix vulnerable systems.</li>
  <li>Security tools use CVE IDs to track, monitor, and patch vulnerabilities across systems and devices.</li>
</ul>
