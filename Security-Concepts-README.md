# ðŸ”’ Security Concepts in Cyber Security.
In cybersecurity, understanding threats, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, payloads, and exploits is essential because they describe the core mechanics of how cyberattacks occur and spread.

<h2>Threats</h2>
A threat is any event or actor that has the potential to cause harm to systems, networks, or data. Threats can be intentional (hackers, malware) or unintentional (human error, system failure).
<strong>Examples of cyber threats:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Malware infections (viruses, worms, trojans)</li>
  <li>Phishing or social engineering</li>
  <li>Insider threats (employee misuse)</li>
  <li>Ransomware and data breaches</li>
  <li>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks</li>
</ul>
A threat becomes dangerous only when it finds a vulnerability it can exploit.

<h2>Weakness</h2>
A weakness is any design flaw, misconfiguration, or human mistake that reduces security. Weaknesses arenâ€™t always exploitable directly but can lead to vulnerabilities if not addressed.
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Poor password management</li>
  <li>Using default or weak encryption</li>
  <li>Missing software updates</li>
  <li>Misconfigured firewalls or open ports</li>
  <li>Insecure APIs or cloud settings</li>
</ul>
Weaknesses form the underlying causes that create vulnerabilities in systems.

<h2>Vulnerabilities</h2>
A vulnerability is a specific flaw in hardware, software, or procedure that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or cause harm.â€‹
<strong>Types:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Software vulnerabilities:</strong> Bugs or coding flaws such as buffer overflows and SQL injection.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware vulnerabilities:</strong> Outdated firmware or exposed device interfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration vulnerabilities:</strong> Weak security settings or excessive permissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Human vulnerabilities:</strong> Phishing susceptibility or unsafe behavior online.</li>
</ul>
Vulnerabilities are identified and cataloged globally through CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) listings, each assigned a severity score (CVSS).

<h2>Exploits</h2>
An exploit is the actual method or piece of code attackers use to take advantage of a vulnerability.
<strong>Exploit lifecycle:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery - the attacker finds a flaw</li>
  <li>Development - Exploit code or script is created.</li>
  <li>Weaponization - payloads (malware or ransomeware) are added to exploit</li>
  <li>Delivery - exploit is sent via phishing, infected websites, or downloadable files.</li>
  <li>Execution - the exploit triggers and achieves its goal (theft, privilege escalation, or takeover).</li>
</ol>
Exploits can target software, networks, or even human users.

<h2>Payloads</h2>
A payload is the component of an exploit or malware that actually performs the malicious action after successful exploitation.
<strong>Common payloads include</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Installing ransomware</li>
  <li>Stealing credentials or financial data</li>
  <li>Logging keystrokes</li>
  <li>Executing remote commands</li>
  <li>Exfiltrating files to a remote server</li>
</ul>
<strong>In simple terms:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The vulnerability is the unlocked door.</li>
  <li>The exploit is the method of opening it</li>
  <li>The payload is what the attacker does once inside.</li>
  <li>The threat is the attacker waiting to strike.</li>
  <li>The weakness is the underlying reason the door was left unlocked.</li>
</ul>
